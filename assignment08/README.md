# Assignment08
**Assignment Title**: DBSCAN

**Assignment Description**: 
This Jupyter Notebook implements DBSCAN with the National Health and Nutirition Examination Survey (NHANES) data in Spark. These are the tasks:
- Create the DBSCAN function
- Recreate Figure 6 heatmap from "Development of a Scalable Method for Creating Food Groups Using the NHANES Dataset and MapReduce"
- Experiment with epsilon and min_pts values for Euclidean Distance and compare with Cosine Similarity

The tasks are completed using PySpark (the Spark Python API) and the power of parallel processing.

**Installation Instructions**: 
- Use Python 3: Ensure that all your code is written in Python 3. We will be executing your code using a Python 3 interpreter. Code written in Python 2 is likely to encounter issues and may not run correctly.
- Ensure Java, Apache Spark, and PySpark are downloaded and work.
- All code is in the "Assignment08.ipynb" Jupyter notebook.

**Use**:
- Run the cells of the "Assignment08.ipynb" Jupyter notebook.
