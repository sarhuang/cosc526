# Assignment04
**Assignment Title**: Text Analysis 

**Assignment Description**: 
This Jupyter Notebook processes a unicode text file into a string of only upper-case A-Z characters and analyzes the words and characters. *The Count of Monte Cristo* and *Letters of John Keats to Fanny Brawne* are used as examples. 

The tasks are as follows:
- Analyze text for word length frequency
- Analyze text for letter frequency
- Analyze text for positional frequencies of each letter (first, interior, last)

Finally, the results are visualized as histograms.


**Installation Instructions**: 
- Use Python 3: Ensure that all your code is written in Python 3. We will be executing your code using a Python 3 interpreter. Code written in Python 2 is likely to encounter issues and may not run correctly.
- All code is in the "Assignment04.ipynb" Jupyter notebook.
- The text files are included in the same file directory as the notebook.

**Use**:
- Run the cells of the "Assignment04.ipynb" Jupyter notebook.
- Easy to reuse code to analyze any text file (.txt).
