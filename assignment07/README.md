# Assignment07
**Assignment Title**: Implement and visualize k-means in Apache Spark

**Assignment Description**: 
This Jupyter Notebook implements k-means in Spark. It's broken into three parts:
- Calculate the mean coordinates of each cluster
- Read in the points from the provided file, cluster the points into clusters, and then return the clustering results (cluster centroids and clustered points)
- Visualize the clusters in a scatterplot

The tasks are completed using PySpark (the Spark Python API) and the power of parallel processing.

**Installation Instructions**: 
- Use Python 3: Ensure that all your code is written in Python 3. We will be executing your code using a Python 3 interpreter. Code written in Python 2 is likely to encounter issues and may not run correctly.
- Ensure Java, Apache Spark, and PySpark are downloaded and work.
- All code is in the "Assignment07.ipynb" Jupyter notebook.
- The text files are included in the same file directory as the notebook.

**Use**:
- Run the cells of the "Assignment07.ipynb" Jupyter notebook.
- Easy to reuse code to analyze any data file (.txt)
