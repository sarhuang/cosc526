# Assignment03
**Assignment Title**: ProjectEuler Problems (1, 22, 45, 87)

**Assignment Description**: 
This Jupyter Notebook answers problems 1, 22, 45, and 87 from ProjectEuler. These mathetmatical challenges highlight the importance of time complexity and optimization. 

The problems are as follows:
- (From [ProjectEuler Problem 1](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1).) If we list the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get: 3, 5, 6, and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Write a function that finds the sum of the multiples of $p$ or $q$ below $N$. 
- (From [ProjectEuler Problem 22](https://projecteuler.net/problem=22).)
The file p022_names.txt contains one line with over 5000 comma-separated names, each in all-capital letters and enclosed in quotes. Import the names and sort them into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.
- From [ProjectEuler Problem 45](https://projecteuler.net/problem=45).)
Triangular, Pentagonal, and Hexagonal numbers are generated by given formulae. Write a function to find the smallest TPH number bigger than $n$. Use your function to find the smallest TPH bigger than 40755.
- (From [ProjectEuler Problem 87](https://projecteuler.net/problem=87).)
The smallest number expressible as the sum of a prime square, a prime cube, and a prime fourth power is $28 = 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4$. Write code to determine the number of positive integers smaller than $N$ that can be written as the sum of a prime square, a prime cube, and a prime fourth power. 


**Installation Instructions**: 
- Use Python 3: Ensure that all your code is written in Python 3. We will be executing your code using a Python 3 interpreter. Code written in Python 2 is likely to encounter issues and may not run correctly.
- All code is in the "Assignment03.ipynb" Jupyter notebook.

**Use**:
- Run the cells of the "Assignment03.ipynb" Jupyter notebook.
- View solutions to the EulerProject problems.
