    "This notebook provides essential functions to help you complete your assignment. You should work within this notebook, modifying existing code and creating new code to devise a solution.  Each student must upload their own work (i.e., a notebook file and a well-executed README file) to GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "**While solutions might be available online, I encourage you to embrace the challenge and try to develop your own solutions first. Avoid searching for answers online until you've completed the lecture. Use this opportunity to exercise your creativity and problem-solving skills.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key points to remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the notebook, running a cell does not automatically re-execute the preceding cells. If you alter earlier cells, you must manually rerun them to incorporate the changes. To ensure that all cells are current and to prevent errors, utilize the 'Run All' option located in the notebook menu under `Cell -> Run All`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working on Problems 1-4, it is advisable to avoid complex optimizations in your initial code. Instead, concentrate on creating a basic, functional script that is straightforward and easy to debug. Begin with a simple solution that works correctly, even if it means using less extensive input than required for the final problem. After achieving a working script, commit it to your GitHub repository. Subsequently, shift your focus to devising an optimized solution. This advanced solution may be quite different from your initial attempt, often involving a distinct mathematical approach for improved efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding Problem 3, avoid getting too involved with the complexity of data structures. While a basic solution might use certain data structures, the more advanced solution probably does not rely heavily on complex or novel data structures. Solving this problem efficiently involves two key insights, one of which is the effective utilization of the solve_quad() function."

    "## Problem 1:\n",
    "(From [ProjectEuler Problem 1](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1).) If we list the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get: 3, 5, 6, and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Write a function that finds the sum of the multiples of $p$ or $q$ below $N$. \n",

    "#### Assumptions and constraints:\n",

    "Assume that $1 \\leq p < q < N$ and that each of these values are integers. Your code should be able to (a) handle values of $N$ up to at least 100,000,000 and (b) terminate in less than 1 second.\n",

    "- There are two general approaches to this problem, the naÃ¯ve (slower) approach and a more mathematical (faster) approach involving the [inclusion-exclusion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion%E2%80%93exclusion_principle). To meet the performance constraints, you will have to implement the fast approach.\n",

    "\n",
    "The sum_up function is O(1) because it's basic arithmetic operations. The time complexity of calculating the greatest common divisor in the lcm function is O(log(min(a, b))). The sumOfMultiples function is O(log(min(p, q))) since it's the sum of the time complexities of sum_up and lcm. Therefore, the faster implementation has a time complexity of O(log(min(p, q))).\n",
    "\n",
    "The naive approach has a time complexity of O(n) because it iterates over all numbers from 0 to n-1. My solution has a faster time complexity than the naive appraoch which explains the faster execution time."

    "1. The main resource I used was GeeksforGeeks's explanation on the Sieve of Eratosthenes (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sieve-of-eratosthenes/) for problem 4. I also looked at their article about time complexity (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/understanding-time-complexity-simple-examples/) for a reminder and how to efficiently write LCM (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-program-to-find-lcm-of-two-numbers/) for problem 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. I encountered bugs in almost every problem, but they were mainly mathematical errors. In problem 1, it took some time to figure out the closed-form formula and make sure I'm performing the right arithmetic operations. Problem 3 also was try and error figuring out the mathetmatical operations. Same with problem 4 and making sure I implemented Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm correctly. \n",
    "\n",
    "3.  When given a concept I am not aware of, I usually look at many different sources to make sure the information is uniform. It definitely took some time to try to understand the math first before coding. sThese problems were also a good reminder that it's easier to code by breaking the problem down into parts. Make sure the not fully optimized code works first and then worry about improving it.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  I did not consult with others, but I would imagine that I would be asking others on what resources they used. The math and formulas are the hardest part, so I would be consulting them to make sure we're implementing them correctly. It's always nice to see slightly different implementations and problem-solving that lead to the same answer."
