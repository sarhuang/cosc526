**Assignment Title**: Cleaning Data Using NHANES Dataset

**Assignment Description**: 
This Jupyter Notebook develops methods to fix the problem of missing values in the NHANES dataset and cluster the food data based on macronutrient content. 

Tasks:
- Determine optimal value for K using elbow method. Plot results of the elbow method and clusters found.
- Define a method to remove missing values and apply to the data. Cluster the modified data and plot resulting clusters.
- Define a method to fill missing macronutrient values with the mean of observed macronutrient values and apply this method to the data. Cluster the modified food data and plot the resulting clusters.

**Installation Instructions**: 
- Use Python 3: Ensure that all your code is written in Python 3. We will be executing your code using a Python 3 interpreter. Code written in Python 2 is likely to encounter issues and may not run correctly.
- Ensure Java, Apache Spark, and PySpark are downloaded and work.
- All code is in the "Assignment09.ipynb" Jupyter notebook.

**Use**:
- Run the cells of the "Assignment09.ipynb" Jupyter notebook.
