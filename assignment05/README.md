# Assignment05
**Assignment Title**: Text Parsing using MapReduce Programming Model

**Assignment Description**: 
This Jupyter Notebook processes a unicode text file into a string of only upper-case A-Z characters and analyzes the words and characters. *The Count of Monte Cristo* [1] and *Plays of Sophocles: Oedipus the King; Oedipus at Colonus; Antigone* [2] are used as examples. 
The tasks are as follows:
- Analyze text for word length frequency
- Analyze text for letter frequency
- Analyze text for positional frequencies of each letter (first, interior, last)

The tasks are completed using sequential MapReduce to develop methods that can be used with the parallel MapReduce from Apache Spark.

**Installation Instructions**: 
- Use Python 3: Ensure that all your code is written in Python 3. We will be executing your code using a Python 3 interpreter. Code written in Python 2 is likely to encounter issues and may not run correctly.
- All code is in the "Assignment05.ipynb" Jupyter notebook.
- The text files are included in the same file directory as the notebook.

**Use**:
- Run the cells of the "Assignment05.ipynb" Jupyter notebook.
- Easy to reuse code to analyze any text file (.txt) in English.
