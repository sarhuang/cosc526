# Problem 3
**Assignment Title**: Managing Files in Dataverse - Noble Prize Use Case

**Assignment Description**: 
This Jupyter Notebook computes basic analyses on a dataset from the Noble Prize official site (https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/lists/all-nobel-prizes/) with all Nobel prizes awarded since 1901. The data is gathered in a CSV file and hosted on Harvard's Dataverse.

The data tasks are as follows:
- Count the number of Nobel Prizes awarded in each of the following categories: Chemistry, Economics, Literature, Peace, Physics, and Physiology or Medicine.
- Identify the instances where Nobel Prizes were not awarded in these categories, along with the specific years when this occurred.
- Determine how many times the Nobel Peace Prize was shared between two individuals.
- Calculate the number of times the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was shared among three individuals.


**Installation Instructions**: 
- Use Python 3: Ensure that all your code is written in Python 3. We will be executing your code using a Python 3 interpreter. Code written in Python 2 is likely to encounter issues and may not run correctly.
- All code is in the "Assignment02.ipynb" Jupyter notebook.

**Use**:
- Run the cells of the "Assignment02.ipynb" Jupyter notebook.
- See analyses of the Nobel prize dataset with category counts and how many prizes were shared with multiple winners.
