    "# COSC 426 / 526 - Assignment 01\n",
    "\n",

    "### Due:  Jan 31, 2025 before 8AM ET\n",

    "---\n",
    "This notebook contains essential functions for your assignment. You will need to enhance and write additional code to complete the tasks. Please submit your completed work to the designated GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is crafted to assess your proficiency in Python programming. You are encouraged to solve the problems using your current knowledge and skills, refraining from searching for solutions online. Be aware that future assignments in this course may present more complexity than this initial task.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "For your project, please adhere to the following straightforward requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Python 3:** Ensure that all your code is written in Python 3. We will be executing your code using a Python 3 interpreter. Code written in Python 2 is likely to encounter issues and may not run correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Format:** Your code should be presented in one of two formats:\n",
    "\n",
    "* As a single Python script, saved with a .py file extension.\n",
    "* As a Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "These requirements are essential to ensure that your code is compatible and can be executed smoothly in our environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Information\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you will be working with a dataset available from [this Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/omicron-covid19-variant-daily-cases?select=covid-variants.csv). Additionally, a copy of this dataset is located in the same directory as this Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset provides information on the processing of COVID-19 sequence data by different countries over a period of time. It is formatted as a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file, containing the following six key columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `location`: This column indicates the specific country to which the data pertains.\n",
    "2. `date`: This column shows the date on which the data was recorded.\n",
    "3. `variant`: This column identifies the specific COVID-19 variant related to the data entry.\n",
    "4. `num_sequences`: This column reflects the count of sequences that have been **processed** for the respective country, variant, and date.\n",
    "5. `num_sequences_total`: This column indicates the total count of sequences that are available for the specified country, variant, and date.\n",
    "6. `perc_sequences`: This column indicates the total count of sequences that are available for the specified country, variant, and date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row in the dataset corresponds to the record of sequences processed for a particular COVID-19 variant in a specific country on a given day."

    "Summary:\n",
    "Genevieve extensively describes how Morgan the Conqueror surveyed his country and how that data affected English life for hundreds of years. This big data can be broken down into surveys (data), the Winchester Roll to organize the data (framework), and how it was used to judge citizens (extract value). She states that today's big data is broken into facts, visualization/analytics, and algorithms. Facts and raw data are complicated to understand due to people's nature to lie. Visualizations can clear up facts, and analytics can decide what data is relevant. Algorithms are only as good as the facts we feed them because they ultimately make the answers we want them to make. While big data seems to be big data = data + visualization/analytics + algorithms, humans are also in the equation. Big data starts and ends with humans, not technology. The only things stopping us are intellect and imagination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three key concepts/insights gained from video:\n",
    "- Big data is just a combination of data, visualization/analytics, algorithms, and humans.\n",
    "- Visualization makes facts easier to see whereas analytics gives those facts meaning.\n",
    "- The Domesday Book preserved centuries-old data and was still used to shape English life in land ownership, tax base, etc. It begs the question of if and how modern data could be stored to last 1000 years like the Domesday Book."
